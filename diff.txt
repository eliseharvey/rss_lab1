-Through my fingers to the deep,
-How few! yet how they creep
-All that we see or seem
-Is it therefore the less gone?
+In a vision, or in none,
 Take this kiss upon the brow!
-Through my fingers to the deep,
-
-In a night, or in a day,
 That my days have been a dream;
+In a night, or in a day,
+Take this kiss upon the brow!
+Take this kiss upon the brow!
 Of a surf-tormented shore,
-Is all that we see or seem
+Thus much let me avow--
+I stand amid the roar
 And, in parting from you now,
+Take this kiss upon the brow!
+O God! can I not grasp
+Take this kiss upon the brow!
