Through my fingers to the deep,
How few! yet how they creep
All that we see or seem
Is it therefore the less gone?
Take this kiss upon the brow!
Through my fingers to the deep,

In a night, or in a day,
That my days have been a dream;
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Is all that we see or seem
And, in parting from you now,
In a vision, or in none,
Take this kiss upon the brow!
That my days have been a dream;
In a night, or in a day,
Take this kiss upon the brow!
Take this kiss upon the brow!
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Thus much let me avow--
I stand amid the roar
And, in parting from you now,
Take this kiss upon the brow!
O God! can I not grasp
Take this kiss upon the brow!
