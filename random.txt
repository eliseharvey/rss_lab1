Through my fingers to the deep,
How few! yet how they creep
All that we see or seem
Is it therefore the less gone?
Take this kiss upon the brow!
Through my fingers to the deep,

In a night, or in a day,
That my days have been a dream;
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Is all that we see or seem
And, in parting from you now,
