Yet if hope has flown away
Yet if hope has flown away
And I hold within my hand
Is but a dream within a dream.
That my days have been a dream;
But a dream within a dream?I stand amid the roar

Grains of the golden sand--
And, in parting from you now,
And I hold within my hand
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Grains of the golden sand--
O God! can I not grasp

Thus much let me avow--
All that we see or seem
