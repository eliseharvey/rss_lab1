Take this kiss upon the brow!
In a night, or in a day,
But a dream within a dream?O God! can I not save
You are not wrong, who deem
Is all that we see or seem
Is all that we see or seem
Take this kiss upon the brow!
Is all that we see or seem
Grains of the golden sand--
O God! can I not save
Thus much let me avow--
